Game development demands performance-driven solutions—from rendering complex 3D scenes to managing AI behavior and handling animations. This hands-on book guides you in solving these challenges using high-performance C++ data structures and algorithms. The authors distill their decades of combined industry experience to help you apply practical C++ techniques to create smooth, scalable, and intelligent games. Instead of pseudocode or abstract theory, you’ll work with real, executable examples that translate directly to your projects. Demos in this book have been developed based on raylib library, providing accessible and efficient foundations for learning.
Opening with a structured overview of algorithmic thinking in C++ game development, the book covers advanced algorithms and their applications in real-world game scenarios. You’ll implement data structures that optimize game functionality, solve algorithmic problems efficiently, and enhance gameplay with robust AI and rendering techniques. In addition, the key focus is collision detection, 2D/3D rendering, animation, camera controls, and machine learning-driven AI, all through practical, executable C++ code.
By the end of this book, you’ll be able to confidently apply advanced C++ techniques to develop efficient, scalable, and feature-rich gameplay systems for modern games.</details>

  <summary><h2>Requirements for this book</summary>
To get the most out of this book, you should have a solid foundation in C++ programming, including an understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and data structures. Familiarity with game-related concepts and knowledge, such as rendering, animation, physics, and frame rate management, will also be beneficial in understanding the practical applications of the algorithms introduced. While this book avoids overly complex modern C++ features, a basic grasp of C++ syntax and programming logic is essential for following along with the examples.

### Software and Hardware Requirements

The following table outlines the software and hardware requirements for this book:

| Software/Hardware Covered in the Book | Operating System Requirements         |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Microsoft Visual Studio 2002 with the C++ compiler | Microsoft Windows 10 and up         |

If you run the samples on systems other than Windows, such as macOS, you will need to manually set up the project and copy the source code into the project.

If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code from the book’s GitHub repository (a link is available in the next section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code.
